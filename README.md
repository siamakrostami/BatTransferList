# CoordinatorPattern

This is a project that implements the Coordinator Pattern and MVVM architecture using Swift 5.


## OverView
The Coordinator Pattern is a design pattern that separates navigation logic from view controllers. It allows for better separation of concerns, easier testing, and better code organization. The MVVM architecture, on the other hand, is a design pattern that separates the concerns of the user interface from the business logic of the application.
